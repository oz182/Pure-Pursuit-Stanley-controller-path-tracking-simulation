Vehicle Dynamic simulation - Entry Programming Assignment

In this README file I will describe the various classes in this assignment:

1. Environment - 
    Input: Path length along the x axis
    Output: Set of coordinates (x,y) which draws a sinus based graph

    The class is responsible for giving the path on which the vehicle should move along.

2. Vehicle - 
    Inputs:
    Outputs:

    Description

3. PurePursuitAlgo - 
    Inputs:
    Outputs:

    Description

Other then that, the "Simulation.py" file, contains the needed code for illustarting an animation
of the algorithm.
