Vehicle Dynamic simulation - Entry Programming Assignment

In this README file I will describe the various classes in this assignment:

The idea behined the files architecture, is to try and set the most generic algorithm object. This will make it easy to use it later on real autonumuos system. The algorithm will be able to run as a stand-alone sub system that get's input data from the physical system, and outputs the target for the actuator's controllers.

1. Environment - Contains the constuction of the path. Can be added also with other environment related attributes such as obsteclas, walls, etc.

2. Vehicle - Contains all the properties and abilites of the vehicle.

3. PurePursuitAlgo - 

Other then that, the "Simulation.py" file, contains the needed code for illustarting an animation
of the algorithm.
